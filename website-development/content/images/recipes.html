                <h1>The Wonders of Sri Lanka</h1>
                <p>As a proud Sri Lankan who moved to New Zealand at a very young age my upbringing pertains to a
                    diverse fusion of cultures and interest in food. On one side we have the part of me that honours my
                    Sri Lankan roots while the other half celebrates the kiwi side that I’ve developed after living in
                    New Zealand for so long. Both my parents were born in Colombo, the capital city of Sri Lanka so I
                    can vouch for the outstanding dishes that you can find throughout the country. The flavourful nature
                    of all the spices used in Sri Lankan cooking, I have become spoiled in terms of what I consider
                    delicious food, whenever I’m away from home my mom’s cooking is what I always miss the most! I have
                    been fortunate enough to be blessed with a brilliant chef as a mum so I have a heightened sense for
                    what should be considered delicious and what is considered mediocre. The main purpose behind this
                    website is sharing my passion for food with others and highlighting Sri Lanka’s best dishes along
                    with how you can make them at home.</p>

            <h1>01. Lamprais</h1>
            <h2>Banana Leaf Bundles of Joy: Unwrapping Lamprais</h2>
            <p><br>The food scene of Sri Lanka is quite unique as it had influences from the British, Portuguese,
                Dutch and Malaysian. From 1658 until 1796 Sri Lanka was under occupation by the Netherlands, during this
                period a ethnic
                group known as the Dutch Burghers settled in Sri Lanka. The Dutch Burgher's were decendents from Dutch,
                Portuguese and Sri Lankan
                ancestry and they introduced a dish that would later become lamprais.
                The etymology of lamprais can be traced back to the Dutch word lomprijst or “parcel of food”.
                This is essentially Sri Lankan comfort food at its best! Each time I eat lamprais I can feel my face
                start to glow with happiness and my soul light up with excitement while my tummy puffs up like a
                balloon from all the accompaniments in the dish. The cool thing about lamprais is that the dish is
                flexible and varies in the ingredients used depending on the family. The side dishes used whenever my
                mum makes
                lamprais include Seeni Sambol (caramelised onion relish) which has a spicy and sweet taste, Wambotu Moju
                (eggplant pickle), and a type of short grain rice called Samba cooked in ghee, Fish Cutlets (croquettes
                with tuna
                and potato filling) and Chicken Curry all wrapped up and steamed in banana leaves. The inclusion of the
                banana imparts a unique aroma and taste to the dish, adding a subtle earthy note.</p>

            <h1>02. Kottu</h1>
            <h2>Kottu: When Leftovers Become a Symphony of Flavour</h2>
            <p>Similar to Chinese fried rice that was invented to use leftover rice, Sri Lanka's kottu repurposes
                leftover Godamba roti (a popular local flatbread).
                This street food originated in the Tamil regions of Sri Lanka in the 1970s, likely in Trincomalee or
                Batticaloa. Throughout Sri Lanka, the distinctive sound of bench scrapers chopping
                and mixing roti with vegetables on metal cooktops is like music to the ears as a feast is about to
                arrive. As a Sri Lankan, I can attest that this flavourful, inexpensive dish is arguably one of Sri
                Lanka's hidden treasures,
                one I find myself often craving. The humble origins of this dish can serve as an important lesson
                for us
                all,
                the lesson that resourcefulness and transformation are skills we can use to transform something past
                it's prime
                into something extraodinary and delicious.

                Explain the dish...

                include a photo and how you can make it yourself, emphasise the ease and low cost of the dish.</p>

            <p>The colour and vibrancy from the vegetables featured in the dish also make kottu look like a magnificent
                work of art that makes it both a treat for the eyes and your mouth.
